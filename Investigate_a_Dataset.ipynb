    "### Dataset Description \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset represents the data collected from over 100 thousand medical appointments and it includes several parameters:\n",
    "- Unique identifiers: \"Patient ID\" and \"Appointment ID\"\n",
    "- Dates and times of scheduling and the actual appointment: \"Scheduled Day\" and \"Appointment Day\"\n",
    "- Demographic data: \"Age\", \"Gender\", and \"Neighbourhood\"\n",
    "- Medical condition parameters: \"Hypertension\", \"Diabetes\", \"Alcoholism\", and \"Handicap\"\n",
    "- Additional data: \"Scholarship\" which shows the patients who are subscribed to medical insurance, and \"SMS Received\" to show if the patient received a confirmation message for the medical appointment\n",
    "- The key value: \"No Show\" which determines if the patient showed up for the medical appointment or not\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll examine some of these parameters with relation to the key value to determine if any of these factors can be the reason for a missed medical appointment. This analysis would assist us in predicting if the patient will actually show up in the future for the medical appointment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question(s) for Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are the patient's demographics related to him/her not showing up for the medical appointment?\n",
    "- Is it possible for the patient's medical condition to prevent him/her from showing up?\n",
    "- Can having a scholarship or sending a confirmation SMS be important factors to ensure that the patient shows up?\n",
    "- Will we be able to predict the probability of the patient not showing up based on the available data in this dataset?\n"

    "\n",
    "After performing the exploration process on the patient's dmographic data, medical condition, and additional parameters, we concluded the following:\n",
    "- Patients from 5 nieghbourhoods (Ilhas Oceânicas De Trindade, Itararé, Santa Cecília, Santa Clara, Santos Dumont) are more likely to miss their medical appointments in comparison to other neighbourhoods\n",
    "- Patients with high degree of disability are more likely to miss their medical appointment compared to healthy patients or patients with low degree of disability\n",
    "- We cannot use the patient's gender, age, and medical condition as indicators for predicting whether he/she shows up for the medical appointment or not\n",
    "- Investigating the dataset revealed that patients who receive a confirmation SMS for their medical appointment are more likely to miss it, also patients who have scholarship program are more likely to miss their medical appointment compared to patients who are not subscribed to the scholarship program\n",
    "- Further analysis can be performed on Patient ID to identify patients with several instances of missing their medical appointment, also we can further explore the difference between the scheduling date and appointment date to determine if the date gap between them would be a factor in the patient forgetting the appointment date and not showing up\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the collected parameters or patient characteristics in this dataset cannot be a viable indicator that would effectively enable us to predict the future probability of a patient showing up for the medical appointment or not.\n",
    "In my opinion, we need to collect more data such as medical appointment urgency based on the patient's condition, the appointment medical specialty, or the seasonal diseases information. \n",
